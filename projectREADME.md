# <Horiseon>

## Description

This project is to update the code for the company Horiseon. The code consisted of <div> elements. These elements were not consistent with HTML 5 format. The <div> elements were updated to represent more informative HTML elements. The code was also simplified to a limited amount of class attributes. This makes the code easier to read and be used by other programmers. This allowed the CSS file to be reduced in size and input simpler code. This project emphases the importance that class elements are labeled the same, and that the less code there is the simpler the code is. It also demonstrates how a change in the HTML file can impact the CSS styling for the entire website.
